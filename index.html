            I am writing to bring to your attention that most high schools in India do not provide the opportunity for students to participate in STEM research. Despite my interest in these fields, I have not had the opportunity to gain research experience in a lab setting.<br>

            At last, I would share something which I didn't shared in the application. As a student in 10th standard, I unfortunately found myself becoming easily distracted, which resulted in lower marks than I had hoped for. Through this experience, I have come to realize the importance of staying focused and motivated in order to achieve my goals. I have learned that it is essential to prioritize my studies and to make the most of my time in order to succeed. I know that in the future I will make sure to avoid distractions and to stay on track, so that I can achieve the success that I am capable of. This experience has been a valuable learning opportunity for me and I am determined to not repeat the same mistake again.
